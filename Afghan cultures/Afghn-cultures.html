                <p>Code to Inspire is a nonprofit committed to teaching female students in Afghanistan how to code.

Courses in coding, access to tech & professional resources, and job placement will enable CTI students to attain employment that is both financially rewarding and socially accessible. In areas where women's travel can be heavily restricted, the ability to work remotely is a key tool in the push for equality. Access to the wealth of the global tech economy enables CTI students to add unique value to their households and their communities, and to challenge the traditional gender roles in Afghanistan with the best argument out there, results.Code To Inspire (CTI) is an after-school program founded by Fereshteh Forough in January of 2015.</p>
